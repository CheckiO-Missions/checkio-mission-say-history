        Can you show me how can I use it for this mission?

    <div class="answer">
        Sure.
<pre class="brush: python">
"Hi. My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format('Alex', 32)
</pre>

        Show me more...
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Well. 'Alex' and 32 are input arguments name and age for function say_hi.
        Which means the extpression might look like this
<pre class="brush: python">
"Hi. My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format(name, age)
</pre>
    </div>

        Looks like it is a solution, but still doesn't work. What I'm doing wrong?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        on CheckiO your solution should be a function. Which means the final version should look like this
<pre class="brush: python">
def say_hi(name, age):
    return "Hi. My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format(name, age)
</pre>
        This this it. Just use this code to check the mission and go try to solve the next one
